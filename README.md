##  Overview of the Project

### Project: Design FSMs using Verilog or VHDL in the VLSI software
environment. Write testbenches to test different states and
transitions of the FSM. Simulate the FSM behavior and verify its
correctness.

### We'll cover the following steps:

Designing the FSM in Verilog.
Writing the Testbench.
Simulating the FSM Behavior.
Verifying the FSM Correctness.

1. Designing the FSM in Verilog
Let's design a simple FSM as an example: a traffic light controller. The FSM will have three states: RED, GREEN, and YELLOW. The FSM will cycle through these states in a specific order.

2. Writing the Testbench
3.  Simulating the FSM Behavior
To simulate the FSM, you would typically use a VLSI software environment like ModelSim, Vivado, or any other HDL simulator. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Compile the Verilog Code: Load both the FSM module and the testbench into your simulator.

Run the Simulation: Start the simulation to observe how the FSM transitions between states and how the output changes.

Check the Results: Verify that the FSM transitions between states as expected and that the output signals match the expected values for each state.

4. Verifying the FSM Correctness
Check the simulation results to ensure that:

The FSM transitions through RED, GREEN, and YELLOW states in the correct order.
The output light corresponds to the current state as specified:
RED should be 2'b00
GREEN should be 2'b01
YELLOW should be 2'b10
Review the timing diagrams generated by the simulator to confirm that the FSM operates correctly and that there are no unexpected transitions or glitches.
